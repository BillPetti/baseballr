# baseballr 1.6.0

Primarily focused on parameter changes to the `fg_*()` functions to allow for more flexible data retrieval. See below for details.

The parameters are now as follows for the leaderboard functions:

- `age` (integer) Age of players
- `pos` (character) Position of players, defaults to "all". To exclude pitchers, use  "np".
- `stats` (character) Statistic to return. Defaults to "bat".
- `lg` (character) League to return. Defaults to "all". Options are "al", "nl", or  "all".
- `qual` (character) Whether you want only batters/pitchers that qualified in a given - season, or the minimum number of plate appearances for inclusion. If you only want - qualified hitters, use qual. If a minimum number of plate appearaces/innings - pitched, use the number desired. Defaults to "y".
- `startseason` (character) Season for which you want to scrape the data.
- `endseason` (character) Last season for which you want data.
- `startdate` (character) Start date for which you want data.
- `enddate` (character) End date for which you want data.
- `month` (character) Month for which you want data.
- `hand` (character) Handedness of batter. Options are "L", "R", or "B". Empty string - returns all.
- `team` (character) Teams for which you want data, comma separated.
- `pageitems` (character) Number of items per page.
- `pagenum` (character) Page number.
- `ind` (character) Whether or not to break the seasons out individual, or roll them  up together. 1 = split seasons, 0 = aggregate seasons.
- `rost` (character) Whether or not to include players on the roster. 1 = include, 0 = - exclude.
- `players` (character) Whether or not to include players on the roster. 1 = include  only active roster players, 0 = exclude.
- `type` (character) Defaults to 8, which is the standard leaderboard. The values for - the leaderboards appear to go to from type = 0 to 48+, which correspond to links - on the leaderboard page.
- `postseason` (logical) Whether or not to include postseason data. TRUE = include  postseason, FALSE = exclude postseason.
- `sortdir` (character) Sort direction. Options are "asc" or "desc" or "default".
- `sortstat` (character) Sort by stat. Default is "WAR".

This change affects the following functions:
- `fg_team_batter()`
- `fg_team_pitcher()`
- `fg_batter_leaders()`
- `fg_pitcher_leaders()`


# baseballr 1.5.0

### Major NCAA function changes

 **New Functions**
 
 Adds the following NCAA baseball functions:
 
  - ```ncaa_teams()```
  - ```load_ncaa_baseball_teams()```
  - ```load_ncaa_baseball_season_ids()```
  - ```load_ncaa_baseball_schedule()```
  - ```load_ncaa_baseball_pbp()```
  - ```ncaa_pbp()``` (see below)
  - ```ncaa_roster()``` (see below)
  - ```ncaa_team_player_stats()``` (see below)
  
 **Parameter Changes**
 
 * `ncaa_*()` functions now return `team_id` and `team_name` instead of `school_id` and `school`
 * `ncaa_*()` functions now uniformly use `team_id` instead of `teamid`, `year` (vs. `team_year`). This affects the following functions:
   - ```ncaa_roster()```
   - ```ncaa_schedule_info()```
   - ```ncaa_park_factor()```
   - ```ncaa_team_player_stats()```
 * ```ncaa_lineups()``` function removes the `year` parameter (was unnecessary)
 * Add `proxy` rlang dots option for passing ```httr::use_proxy()`` option to `ncaa_*()` functions
   
 **Function Aliasing**
 
 * ```ncaa_baseball_pbp()``` has been aliased to ```ncaa_pbp()``` for naming consistency
 * ```ncaa_baseball_roster()``` has been aliased to ```ncaa_roster()``` for naming consistency
 * ```ncaa_scrape()``` has been aliased to ```ncaa_team_player_stats()``` for more descriptive naming
 
 **Notes**
 
 * ```ncaa_schedule_info()``` runs much slower because it is gathering the information on all of the game play-by-play URLs for each game to get a proper `game_pbp_id` link as opposed to the `contest_id` link alone. These additional values are returned as `game_pbp_id` and `game_pbp_url` which can also now be used in the `ncaa_pbp()` function.
 
### Other Fixes

 * ```chadwick_player_lu()``` function updated to address data source change
 * Under the hood fixes for mlb_venues(), fg_team_batter(), fg_team_pitcher(),
  fg_batter_leaders(), fg_pitcher_leaders(), chadwick_player_lu()

# baseballr 1.4.0
 * Minor updates under the hood for tidyselect version changes affecting dplyr and tidyr functions under the hood

# baseballr 1.3.0
 * Vignette contributed by [\@camdenk](https://github.com/camdenk), *Using Statcast Pitch Data*.  
 * ```sptrc_league_payrolls()``` function added (contributed by [\@camdenk](https://github.com/camdenk))
 * ```sptrc_team_active_payrolls()``` function added (contributed by [\@camdenk](https://github.com/camdenk))
 * ```fg_team_batter()``` function added (contributed by [\@camdenk](https://github.com/camdenk))
 * ```fg_team_pitcher()``` function added (contributed by [\@camdenk](https://github.com/camdenk))
 * Updates documentation per CRAN's request

# baseballr 1.2.0
 * Removed two `pitchRx`-dependent functions, updated retrosheet function and documentation
 * Removed `edge_scrape()` and `edge_scrape_split()` from package. See `data-raw/archived/` for the last updated script. These may be re-visited at a later date with improved data repository maturity.
 * Retrosheet functions updated to use tempdir()/tempfile() methods by default. Will need to specify a working directory to enable old functionality in which files are written to disk permanently. New default functionality is to return a named list with two tibbles per year specified: 'events' and 'rosters'.

## New Functions

Thanks to [Robert Frey](https://github.com/robert-frey), we've added a new function that allows the user to calculate park factors at the NCAA level. 

`get_ncaa_park_factors` takes two arguments; `teamid`, `years`, and `type`. Users can submit a single year or multiple years (recommended) and uses a team's schedule with results to calculate their home park's factors. Also, if a user selects `conference` as the type, the park factor will be adjusted based on the number of teams in a conference. This has the practical effect of suggesting more regression should be applied to players who play against fewer teams in fewer parks. 

The function will return two versions of the park factor: the `base_pf` and the `final_pf`, which simply takes the `base_pf` and applies an adjustment that is based on [FanGraphs' method](https://library.fangraphs.com/park-factors-5-year-regressed/):

```
get_ncaa_park_factor(736, c(2017:2019),type = "conference")
      school home_game away_game runs_scored_home runs_allowed_home runs_scored_away
1 Vanderbilt       104        91              782               416              591

1               680   1.209         1.098    1.093
```

## Fixes and Updates

- [Shane Piesik](https://github.com/shanepiesik) made some changes to the `scrape_statcast_savant` function. The function should now be easier to use in a loop or map when combining payloads, and more importantly the data should read in faster thanks to swapping in `vroom`.

- The `master_ncaa_team_lu` was updated by Robert Frey. For some reason, the NCAA website that had the 2019 Division 1 information has disappeared, and when I rebuilt the table at the beginning of 2020 it led to tons of `NA` values for those teams that year. Thanks to Robert for manually fixing.

## Other

Messages have been added to all functions that pull data from [FanGraphs.com](https://plus.fangraphs.com/product/fangraphs-membership/?switch-subscription=254671&item=85029&_wcsnonce=62a468b8ba&auto-switch=true) and [Baseball-Reference.com](https://stathead.com). The messages ask users to support both sites through their paid subscription services. Please consider supporting both, especially if you are using `baseballr` to pull data from their sites.

# baseballr 0.7 (2020-01-07)

## New Functions

This release of [`baseballr`](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr) includes functions   that allow a user to query data through MLB's stats api at the minor league level.

You can view a look up table with `?get_game_pks_mlb` to get the appropriate IDs for each level, but I'll post them here as well (this is not comprehensive):

| 1 | MLB |
|------|----------------------|
| 11 | Triple-A |
| 12 | Double-A |
| 13 | Class A Advanced |
| 14 | Class A |
| 15 | Class A Short Season |
| 5442 | Rookie Advanced |
| 16 | Rookie |
| 17 | Winter League |

Game information can be acquired using the `get_game_pks_mlb` function, along with the level for which you want games:

```
games <- get_game_pks_mlb(date = '2019-05-01',
                          level_ids = c(11, 12))

games %>%
  select(game_pk, gameDate, teams.away.team.name, teams.home.team.name) %>%
  slice(1:10)
  
   game_pk             gameDate      teams.away.team.name  teams.home.team.name
1   579921 2019-05-01T16:05:00Z        Round Rock Express Oklahoma City Dodgers
2   579919 2019-05-01T03:33:00Z        Round Rock Express Oklahoma City Dodgers
3   584340 2019-05-01T21:30:00Z        Midland RockHounds        Tulsa Drillers

7   571587 2019-05-01T14:30:00Z            Erie SeaWolves         Altoona Curve
8   572288 2019-05-01T14:30:00Z New Hampshire Fisher Cats       Trenton Thunder
9   575163 2019-05-01T14:35:00Z             Norfolk Tides          Durham Bulls
10  575655 2019-05-01T14:35:00Z           Louisville Bats       Toledo Mud Hens
```																	

You can also use the `get_game_info_mlb` function to grab additional info on each game, such as weather and (in some cases) attendance:

```
map_df(.x = games$game_pk[1:10], 
       ~get_game_info_mlb(.x)) %>%
  select(game_date, venue_name, temperature, other_weather, wind)

# A tibble: 10 x 5
   game_date  venue_name                 temperature other_weather wind           
   <chr>      <chr>                      <chr>       <chr>         <chr>

 6 2019-05-01 Principal Park             53          Overcast      1 mph, Calm    
 7 2019-05-01 Peoples Natural Gas Field  58          Overcast      7 mph, In From…
 8 2019-05-01 ARM & HAMMER Park          55          Overcast      5 mph, L To R  
 9 2019-05-01 Durham Bulls Athletic Park 70          Partly Cloudy 7 mph, In From…
10 2019-05-01 Fifth Third Field          59          Cloudy        7 mph, R To L  
```

Once you have the `game_pk` IDs grabbing the pbp data is very simple. All you need to do is pass the `game_pk` of interest to the `get_pbp_mlb` function. 

Let's say you interested in the Gwinnett Stripers versus the Charlotte Knights:

```
payload <- get_pbp_mlb(575589)
```

The function will return a data frame with 131 columns. Data availability will vary depending on the park and the league level, as most sensor data is not available in minor league parks via this API. Also note that the column names have mostly been left as-is and there are likely duplicate columns in terms of the information they provide. I plan to clean the output up down the road, but for now I am leaving the majority as-is.

Some of the columns of interest at the minor league level are:

- `pitchNumber` and `atBatIndex`: the pitch number within a given plate appearance and the plate appearance within a given game.
- `pitchData.coordinates.x` and `pitchData.coordinates.y`: the x,z coordinates of the pitch as it crosses the plate. As far as I can tell, these are the pixel coordinates for a location that a stringer manually plots and likely need to be transformed and rotated to get a view of the pitch as it crosses the plate. I am working on figuring out an easy transformation to get them on the same scale as the MLB coordinates, but they appear different by park. I do believe you can multiple both by -1 and that will at least allow you to orient the coordinates correctly (i.e. catcher's view)
- `details.call.code`, `details.call.description`, `result.event`, `result.eventType`, and `result.description`: these are similar to what we find with Statcast data--codes and detailed descriptions for what happened on a pitch or at the end of a plate appearance.
- `count.` variables that tell you how many balls, strikes, and outs before and after the pitch.
- `batter.id` and `pitcher.id`
- `matchup.batSide.code ` and `matchup.pitchHand.code`: handedness of the batter and pitcher.
- A series of columns that tell you what the league and level is of both the home and away teams and includes their parent organizations.
- `batted.ball.result`, `hitData.coordinates.coordX`, `hitData.coordinates.coordY`, `hitData.trajectory`: various information about the batted ball. Of most interest will be the coordinate columns.

# baseballr 0.4 (2019-03-18)

The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package for `R` includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

## New Functions

`fg_pitch_leaders()`

This function is the compliment to the `fg_bat_leaders()` function, returning leaderboard information for pitchers from FanGraphs.com.

In addition to noting the start and end years, along with qualified/IP requirements, etc., you can note whether you want all pitchers, starters, or just relievers using the `pitcher_type` argument. 

- `pit` will give you all pitchers that meet your requirements
- `sta` gives you starters only 
- `rel` gives you relievers only

```
fg_pitch_leaders(2018,2018, pitcher_type = "sta") %>% slice (1:10) %>% .[,1:10]

   playerid Seasons  #             Name      Team Age  W  L  ERA  G

```

`scrape_statcast_leaderboards()`

The `scrape_statcast_leaderboards()` function can be used to access all of the leaderboards available from [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) as csv downloads. The function isn't doing anything too sophisticated; it simply builds the appropriate url for the csv download based on a series of parameters and then reads the csv into `R`.

Users specify which leaderboard they want to download using the `leaderboard` argument. The following are currently available:

- `exit_velocity_barrels`
- `expected_statistics`
- `pitch_arsenal`
- `outs_above_average`
- `directional_oaa`
- `catch_probability`
- `pop_time`
- `sprint_speed`
- `running_splits_90_ft`

Each leaderboard has different parameters that can be specific to alter the content of the downloads, but not all parameters work for every leaderboard. (I would check the leaderboard interface on BaseballSavant directly if you are not sure which ones to use.) Some of the leaderboards do not include a variable for the `year` selected, so the function will check if it exists and, if not, it will add a column based on your parameter setting.

Here is an example of the `expected_statistics` leaderboard for pitchers who faced at least 250 batters in 2018:

```
payload <- scrape_savant_leaderboards(leaderboard = "expected_statistics", 
					year = 2018, 
					player_type = "pitcher", 
					min_pa = 250)

payload %>%
	arrange(est_woba) %>% 
	select(year:last_name, pa, woba:est_woba_minus_woba_diff)

`milb_batter_game_logs_fg()`
`milb_pitcher_game_logs_fg()`

These functions were contributed by [Mat Adams](https://github.com/matawith1t), and they are similar to the game log functions included in an earlier release except that they will return minor league game logs for the player specified. The functions take only two arguments: `playerid` and `year`. The `playerid` is the minor league ID assigned by FanGraphs. This can be found in the url slug for a minor league player's page. 

For example, here is the url for Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s minor league game logs: https://www.fangraphs.com/statsd.aspx?playerid=sa920245&position=3B&gds=&gde=

You will see the `playerid=` portion of the url, and the actual ID follows (i.e. sa920245).

```
milb_batter_game_logs_fg(playerid = "sa920245", year = 2017) %>% slice(1:10)

                    name minor_playerid       Date Team Level  Opp  AVG G AB PA H

# baseballr 0.3.4 (2018-05-29)

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package for `R` (0.3.4) includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

## New Functions

`run_expectancy_code()`

This function formats Baseball Savant data so that users can generate the run expectancy for different base-out or count-base-out states. It will also append the data frame with new variables necessary for generating linear weights (see new function below). The only argument is a data frame downloaded from Baseball Savant

Columns created and appended to Baseball Savant data:

- `final_pitch_game`: whether a pitch was the final one thrown in a game
- `final_pitch_inning`: whether a pitch is the final one thrown in an inning
- `final_pitch_at_bat`: whether a pitch is the final one thrown in an at bat
- `runs_scored_on_pitch`: how many runs scored as a result of the pitch
- `bat_score_start_inning`: the score for the batting team at the beginning of the inning
- `bat_score_end_inning`: the score for the batting team at the end of the inning
- `bat_score_after`: the score for the batting team after the pitch is thrown
- `cum_runs_in_inning`: how many cumulative runs have been scored from the beginning of the inning through the pitch
- `runs_to_end_inning`: how many runs were scored as a result of the pitch through the end of the inning
- `base_out_state` or `count_base_out_state`: the specific combination of base-outs or count-base-outs when the pitch was thrown
- `avg_re`: the average run expectancy of that base-out or count-base-out state
- `next_avg_re`: the average run expectancy of the base-out or count-base-out state that results from the pitch
- `change_re`: the change in run expectancy as a result of the pitch
- `re24`: the total change in run expectancy through the end of the inning resulting from the pitch based on the change in base-out or count-base-out state plus the number of runs scored as a result of the pitch/at bat

Example:

```r
> x2016_statcast_re <- run_expectancy_code(x2016_statcast)

> sample_n(x2016_statcast_re, 10) %>%
    select(final_pitch_inning:re24) %>%
    glimpse()

```

`run_expectancy_table()`

This functions works with the `run_expectancy_code` function and does the work of generating the run expectancy tables that are automatically exported into the Global Environment

Example:

```r
> x2016_statcast_re %>%

`linear_weights_savant()`

This function works in tandem with `run_expectancy_code()` to generate linear weights for offensive events after the Baseball Savant data has been properly formatted. Currently, the function will return linear weights above average and linear weights above outs. It does not apply any scaling to align with league wOBA. Users can do that themselves if they like, or it may be added to a future version of the function.

Example:

```r

> x2016_statcast_re %>%
  linear_weights_savant() %>%
  print(n=Inf)

I used Baseball Savant data from 2010-2015 and compared the linear weights generated by `baseballr` to those by Tom Tango using retrosheet data. `baseballr`'s weights are generally a little lower than what Tango generated, but that could be due to a number of things, such as the data source, code, etc., but the values appear reasonable enough to be reliable:

We also had some great contributions by others that I've added into this release:

`label_statcast_imputed_data()`

[Ben Dilday](https://github.com/bdilday) again contributes with a cool experimental function meant to tag batted ball cases where significant imputation may have been used to generate some of the Statcast values by MLBAM, i.e. `launch_speed` and `launch_angle`. You can read more about Ben's function [here](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr/pull/71).

`fg_park()`

[Sam Boysel](https://github.com/sboysel) updated the park factors function so that it now includes the new columns added by FanGraphs (5-year, 3-year, 1-year park factors) and ensures the column names are correct

## Upgrades

`fg_bat_leaders()`

- `playerid` now returned as part of the data returned.  
- Dozens of additional variables are also returned, including aggregate data from Pitch Info as well as contact type.

## Bug Fixes

`process_statcast_payload()`
- hc_x, hc_y are now converted to numeric  


# baseballr 0.3.3 (2017-05-08)

The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package for `R` includes a number of enhancement to acquiring data from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) as well as minor grammatical clean up in the documentation.

Previous functions `scrape_statcast_savant_batter` and `scrape_statcast_savant_pitcher` allowed for the acquistion of data from baseballsavant.com for a given player over a user-determined time frame. However, this is somewhat inefficient if you want to acquire data on all players over a given time frame. 

Two new functions have been added, `scrape_statcast_savant_batter_all` and `scrape_statcast_savant_pitcher_all`, that allow a user to acquire data for either all pitchers or all hitters over a given time frame.

Both functions take only two arguments:

`start_date`: the first date for which the user wants records returned
`end_date`: the final date for which the user wants records returned

Remember, baseballsavant.com's csv download option allows for about 50,000 records in a single query. That works out to roughly 10-12 days of games. Longer time frames will take longer to download.

Example: acquire data for all batters from 2017-04-03 through 2017-04-10

```r
> head(scrape_statcast_savant_batter_all('2017-04-03', '2017-04-10'))

# baseballr 0.3.2 (2017-09-12)
 
The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package for `R` includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

In terms of new functions, `statline_from_statcast` allows users to take raw pitch-by-pitch data from Statcast/PITCHf/x and calculate aggregated, stat line-like output. Examples include count data such as number of singles, doubles, etc., as well as rate metrics like Slugging and wOBA on swings or contact.

The function only has two arguments:

* `df`: a data frame that includes pitch-by-pitch information. The function assumes the following columns are present: `events`, `description`, `game_date`, and `type`.
* `base`: base indicates what the denominator should be for the rate stats that are calculated. The function defaults to "swings", but you can also choose to use "contact"

Here is an example using all data from the week of 2017-09-04. Here, we want to see a statline for all hitters based on swings:

```r
test <- scrape_statcast_savant_batter_all("2017-09-04", "2017-09-10")

statline_from_statcast(test)

year swings batted_balls  X1B X2B X3B  HR swing_and_miss swinging_strike_percent    ba
1 2017  13790        10663 1129 352  37 259           3127                   0.227 0.129

obp   slg   ops  woba
1 0.129 0.216 0.345 0.144
```

You can also combine the `statline_from_statcast` function with a loop to create statlines for multiple players at once.

Example: calculate statlines for batters on contact for all games played 2017-09-04 through 2017-09-10:

```r
test <- scrape_statcast_savant_batter_all("2017-09-04", "2017-09-10")

output <- data.frame()

for (i in c("Jose Ramirez", "J.D. Martinez", "Francisco Lindor", "Gary Sanchez", "Rhys Hoskins")) {
  reduced_test <- test %>%
    filter(player_name == i)
  x <- statline_from_statcast(reduced_test, base = "contact")
  x$player <- i
  x <- x %>%
    select(player, everything())
  output <- rbind(output, x) %>%
    arrange(desc(woba))
}

print(output, width = Inf)

# baseballr 0.3.1 (2016-11-22)

The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) includes a function for acquiring player statistics from the [NCAA's website](http://stats.ncaa.org) for baseball teams across the three major divisions (I, II, III).

The function, `ncaa_scrape`, requires the user to pass values for three parameters for the function to work:

`school_id`: numerical code used by the NCAA for each school
`year`: a four-digit year
`type`: whether to pull data for batters or pitchers

If you want to pull batting statistics for Vanderbilt for the 2013 season, you would use the following:

```r
> baseballr::ncaa_scrape(736, 2013, "batting") %>%
+     select(year:OBPct)
   year     school   conference division Jersey            Player Yr Pos GP GS    BA OBPct

```

The same can be done for pitching, just by changing the `type` parameter:

```r
> baseballr::ncaa_scrape(736, 2013, "pitching") %>%
+     select(year:ERA)
   year     school   conference division Jersey           Player Yr Pos GP App GS  ERA

11 2013 Vanderbilt Southeastern        1     40   Pecoraro, T.J. Jr   P 10  10  7 5.97
12 2013 Vanderbilt Southeastern        1     45  Ferguson, Tyler Fr   P  8   8  4 4.21
13 2013 Vanderbilt Southeastern        1     27 Kolinsky, Keenan Jr   P  2   2 NA 0.00

15 2013 Vanderbilt Southeastern        1      -           Totals  -   -  -  NA NA 2.76
16 2013 Vanderbilt Southeastern        1      -  Opponent Totals  -   -  -  NA NA 6.19
```

Now, the function is dependent on the user knowing the `school_id` used by the NCAA website. Given that, I've included a `school_id_lu` function so that users can find the `school_id` they need.

Just pass a string to the function and it will return possible matches based on the school's name:

```r
> school_id_lu("Vand")
# A tibble: 4 × 6
      school   conference school_id  year division conference_id
       <chr>        <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>         <dbl>
1 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2013        1           911
2 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2014        1           911
3 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2015        1           911
4 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2016        1           911
```

# baseballr 0.2.1 (2016-10-08)


Updates to functions in this release:

`scrape_statcast_savant_batter`<br>
`scrape_statcast_savant_pitcher`<br>

New functions in this release:

`code_barrel` <br>

The research team at Major League Baseball Advanced Media have developed a way to categorize batted balls that on average having a batting average over .500 and slugging over 1.500. The specific coding criteria can be found in comment #2 [here] (http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/statcast-lab-barrels#2). 

Now, whenever a user scrapes Statcast data using either the `scrape_statcast_savant_batter` or `scrape_statcast_savant_pitcher` functions the results will include a column `barrel`, where if the batted ball matches the barrel criteria it will code as 1, otherwise 0.

Example:

```r
> scrape_statcast_savant_batter(start_date = "2016-04-06", end_date = "2016-04-15", batterid = 621043) %>% 
+     filter(type == "X") %>%
+     filter(!is.na(barrel)) %>%
+     select(player_name, game_date, hit_angle, hit_speed, barrel) %>%
+     tail()
[1] "Be patient, this may take a few seconds..."
[1] "Data courtesy of Baseball Savant and MLBAM (baseballsavant.mlb.com)"
     player_name  game_date hit_angle hit_speed barrel
25 Carlos Correa 2016-04-07     31.10    103.33      1
26 Carlos Correa 2016-04-07     27.77     87.25      0
27 Carlos Correa 2016-04-06     29.62    103.97      1
28 Carlos Correa 2016-04-06      0.11    105.20      0
29 Carlos Correa 2016-04-06     23.76    113.55      1
30 Carlos Correa 2016-04-06     -2.18    113.39      0
```
If you already have Statcast data--say, in a database that you've been collecting--I've also included a simple function that will take a dataframe and code whether each row contains a barrel or not. All you need to do is pass your dataframe to `code_barrel`.


# baseballr 0.2.0 (2016-08-25)


Functions added to this release:

`scrape_statcast_savant_batter`<br>
`scrape_statcast_savant_pitcher`<br>
`playerid_lookup`

The two savant functions allow a user to retrieve PITCHf/x and Statcast data for either a specific batter or pitcher from [Baseball Savants' Statcast Search] (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search). The user needs to provide a start date, end date, and the batter or pitcher's MLBAMID.

Example:

```r
> scrape_statcast_savant_batter(start_date = "2016-04-06", end_date = "2016-04-15", batterid = 621043) %>% 
     filter(type == "X") %>%
     select(3,7,54:56) %>%
     tail()
[1] "Be patient, this may take a few seconds..."
[1] "Data courtesy of Baseball Savant and MLBAM  (baseballsavant.mlb.com)"     
    game_date   player_name hit_distance_sc hit_speed hit_angle
26 2016-04-07 Carlos Correa             385    103.33     31.10
27 2016-04-07 Carlos Correa             288     87.25     27.77
28 2016-04-06 Carlos Correa             392    103.97     29.62
29 2016-04-06 Carlos Correa             189    105.20      0.11
30 2016-04-06 Carlos Correa             462    113.55     23.76
31 2016-04-06 Carlos Correa             228    113.39     -2.18
```

Since the savant functions require users to pass a valid MLBAMID, a lookup function is included that leverages the Chadwick public register. Users provide a text string and only those players with that string present in their last name will be returned.

Here is an example where the user is looking for players with the last name "Seager":

```r
> playerid_lookup("Seager")
[1] "Be patient, this may take a few seconds..."
[1] "Data courtesy of the Chadwick Bureau Register (https://github.com/chadwickbureau/register)"

# baseballr 0.1.4 (2016-05-24)


Functions added to this release:

`pitcher_boxscore`: This function allows a user to retrieve a boxscore of pitcher statistics for any game played in the PITCHf/x era (2008-current). The function takes a boxscore.xml url as it's only argument and returns boxscore data for both the home and away pitchers.

Example:

```r
> pitcher_boxscore("http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2016/month_05/day_21/gid_2016_05_21_milmlb_nynmlb_1/boxscore.xml") %>% select(id:so)

# baseballr 0.1.3 (2016-03-25)


Functions added to this release:

`edge_code`: This function allows a user to pass their own dataframe and have individual pitches coded according to the scheme provided by Edge%. The dataframe must contain at least three columns of data: `b_height`, `stand`, `px`, and `pz`.

Example (based on data from "2015-04-05"):

```r
> edge_code(df) %>% .[, c(6:7, 27:28, 82)] %>% head(10)
   stand b_height     px    pz    location
1      L      6-3  0.416 2.963 Inside Edge
2      L      6-3 -0.191 2.347       Heart
3      L      6-3 -0.518 3.284  Upper Edge
4      L      6-3 -0.641 1.221 Out of Zone
5      L      6-3 -1.821 2.083 Out of Zone
6      L      6-3  0.627 2.397 Inside Edge
7      L      6-5 -1.088 1.610 Out of Zone
8      L      6-5 -0.257 2.047  Lower Edge
9      L      6-5     NA    NA        <NA>
10     L      6-3 -1.539 1.525 Out of Zone
```

Functions updated for this release:

`standings_on_date_bref`: Updated this function to allow for records to be returned for the given date or from that date forward. Also, users can input a full date string instead of three separate arguments for the day, month, and year. Users can also choose to pull records for the AL and NL overall, not just for a given division.

Example:

```r
> standings_on_date_bref("2015-08-01", "NL East", from = FALSE)
$`NL East`
   Tm  W  L  W-L%   GB  RS  RA pythW-L%

# baseballr 0.1.2 (2016-03-07)


Functions added to this release:

`edge_scrape_split()`: This function builds of off `edge_scrape()` and adds the ability to view the data split by batter and pitcher handedness. As with `edge_scrape()`, the function returns a tibble grouped by either pitchers or batters and the percentage of pitches in each of the various Edge zones, but adds in handedness.

Example (Edge% splits by batters with handedness):

```r
> edge_scrape_split("2015-04-05", "2015-04-05", "batter") %>% .[,c(1:5,9:14)]

# baseballr 0.1.0 (2016-03-01)


Functions added to this release:

`fip_plus()`: This function mimics the functionality in the `woba_plus()` function, except that the unit of analysis is pitchers. The function will generate Fielding Indepedent Pitching (FIP) for each pitcher in the data set that is passed to the function, along with wOBA against and wOBA against on contact.

Example:

```r
> daily_pitcher_bref("2015-04-05", "2015-04-30") %>% fip_plus() %>% select(season, Name, IP, ERA, SO, uBB, HBP, HR, FIP, wOBA_against, wOBA_CON_against) %>% arrange(desc(IP)) %>% head(10)

```

`edge_scrape()`: This function allows the user to scrape PITCHf/x data from the GameDay application using Carson Sievert's [pitchRx](https://github.com/cpsievert/pitchRx) package and to calculate metrics associated with [Edge%](https://billpetti.shinyapps.io/edge_shiny/). The function returns a data.frame grouped by either pitchers or batters and the percentage of pitches in each of the various Edge zones.

Example (pitchers):

```r
> edge_scrape("2015-04-06", "2015-04-07", "pitcher") %>% .[, c(1:3,7:12)] %>% head(10)
